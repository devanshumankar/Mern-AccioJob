1.call by value->for primitive data
primitive:number,string,boolean,null,undefined,NaN
they are passed by the value
2.call by reference->
for non-primitive data:array,object
for ex:a=[10,20,30]
let b=a
that means both a and b points to same reference in the memory
if changes done in any of the array will affect both
